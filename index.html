         Hello, my name is Bryson Cole thank you for visting my live Portfolio. I have been a junior devloper at Intuli LLc. for four years and a developer for the past year. I am currently enrolled in the UW Full-Stack developer bootcamp to increase my skills.
        </p>
        <p>
         This Live Portfolio will be updated with my projects over the course of the bootcamp. Currently only one code refracting project has been completed which is linked down below and the other two are placeholders for me to come back and update in a few weeks. 
        </p>
