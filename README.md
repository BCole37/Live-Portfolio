# Live portfolio 

## Project Detials
This Project was to use the more advanced CSS learned this week to make a Live Portfolio from stratch. This is a project I can continually update and improve to use as somewhat of a virtual resume if I change jobs. Its a quick acces to projects I have completed. 
I Made a working site that allows easy navigation both to the site and other projects.

# Why
Keep a log of the projets I ahve completed in one place to show off my work

# Problems
I Still need to work on the more complex elements such as Flexboxes as I essentailly hardcoded positioning based off my one browser as thats the only way I could get anythign done. 
Formatting and making the site look proffesional

# Problems Solved
That being said there were numerous problems I addressed in new ways.
-I was able to replicate and alter the navigation bar from the first code and adjust it to my purposes which shows to me I am comfertable if I can repeat and alter without messing it up.
-I added a background image along with the title, header, and Nav bar
-I made an aside section that had a right border and the titles for each section
-I broke up the main content into three very distinct sections.
-The first is paragrapgh text with font color inline with the rest of the page
-The second was difficult but it is a background image with a border that when clicked on links to the projects
-The Third has a variety of contacts links such as phone and email.

# Takaways
I Feel I have a strong grasp on many of the simple things of css and html but really struggle with positioning.
