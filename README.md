# Live portfolio 

## Project Detials
This Project was to use the more advanced CSS learned this week to make a Live Portfolio from stratch. This is a project i can continually update and improve to use as somewhat of a virtual resume if I change jobs. Its a quick acces to projects I have completed. 
I Made a working site that allows easy navigation both to the site and other projects.

# Why
To impliment some of the harder CSS and HTML such as linking, Flexboxes, and more streamlined designs. 
Now that we have had experience correcting someone elses code and seeing the issues that can come out of just going for function this was to give us a chance to make a site that is detialed and effcient. 

# Problems
I struggled with this assignment hence why I am a day late. I still didn't meet all the criteria as tryign to adjust based of size just messed up everything so I will have to come back to this project and fix that eventually.
I Still need to work on the more complex elements such as Flexboxes as I essentailly hardcoded positioning based off my one browser as thats the only way I could get anythign done. 
I feel there are m uch more efficeint ways to right out what I did and smooth it over so I need to explore those. 
I think I was so behind as I was very busy this week and couldnt start until friday which resulted in me not knowing the questions I needed to ask the instructors making it so they didn't have an oppurtunity to help me and all I had was self research which found was to brute force the code.
This was an eyeopenmer to at list look over the projects ASAP to see where I think I may struggle and to use my resources better. I think I fell into a trap of I can do this myself.

# Problems Solved
That being said there were numerous problems I addressed in new ways.
-I was able to replicate and alter the navigation bar from the first code and adjust it to my purposes which shows to me I am comfertable if I can repeat and alter without messing it up.
-I Repurposed much of the text from the first homework and reorginized whihc a=gain being able to reuse bits and pieces from somtehing shows the knowledge of it
-I added a background image along with the title, header, and Nav bar
-I made an aside section that had a right border and the titles for each section
-I broke up the main content into three very distinct sections.
-The first is paragrapgh text with font color inline with the rest of the page
-The second was difficult but it is a background image with a border that when clicked on links to the projects
-The Third has a variety of contacts links such as phone and email.

# Takaways
Mainly covered in the problems but I need to make sure to utilize my resources better as most of my problems would have been solved better if I was better prepared for class with the questions I needed answered. 
While It may be inefficient and long I can find ways to force the sites to work.
I Feel I have a strong grasp on many of the simple things of css and html but really struggle with positioning.
